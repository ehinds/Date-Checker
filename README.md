# Date-Checker-C-
Runs various checks to see if the date entered is accurate. Test driver runs the default constructor as well as explicit-value constructor and lists whether the year, month, or day is inaccurate, else it will print the date using display function. Also overloads the extraction operator to print dates and checks if a year is a leap year or not.
